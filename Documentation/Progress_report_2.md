# Progress report 2

Alright, the second week is done, and good progress has been made: all three algorithms mentioned in the specification have been implemented. However, the project is lacking testing completely, and I've not started writing javadocs. The comments that it currently has are more of a reminder or a TODO for myself. The three search algorithms have much in common in the form I've implemented them, and I've been thinking about doing something about that, but we'll see if I'll ever get around to that. Also, I've cut corners in a way - I'm not actually using the list datastructure anywhere, since I noticed I can actually make do without it. I still intend to implement it, but the current form is sort of a backup, in case I end up not doing it for whatever reason.

So far it has been mostly smooth sailing. Next, I'm going to start testing and javadocs, as well as implementing the priority queue.

Time spent this week: ~8h
