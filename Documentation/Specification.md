# Project specification

The goal of this project is to implement several pathfinding algorithms and their datastructures, 
as well as to compare their performances. The algorithms chosen for this project are A*, breadth-first search, 
and Dijkstra's algorithm. These were chosen because they're familiar and there's plenty of material 
on them.
The implementation will be done using the Java programming language, 
and the project documentation will be in English.

## Algorithms
 
 | Algorithm | Time | Space |
 |:----------|:-----:|-----: | 
 | A* | *O(E)* | *O(V)* |
 | Breadth first search | *O(V + E)* | *O(V)* |
 | Dijkstra's algorithm | *O(V + E log V)* | *O(V)* |
 
 The expected time and space complexities (E = number of edges, V = number of vertices).
