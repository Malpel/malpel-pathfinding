# Progress report 5

This week I didn't have much time to work on this project, so I chose to focus on finishing/fixing up parts of the already written code. And it was definitely worth looking into, because there were so many things missing that I knew about (like the heuristic being incomplete, for one), as well as things that I discovered while fixing things. I think the search algorithms are now as bug free as they're going to get. Corner cutting was a source of confusion for a while - now it's entirely removed. There are still some things that need to be changed or removed, but otherwise I feel like the project is in an alright shape. Shame I didn't even have time to do the code review either.

Because this week's plans were completely thrown off course, next week will see the beginning of performance testing and writing the missing documents
