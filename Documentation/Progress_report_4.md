# Progress report 4

The vast majority of effort was spent on understanding and trying to implement the jump point search algorithm. I didn't really understand the way jumping was supposed check for neighbors for a long time, and I had several small mistakes here and there. I think it works now. Other stuff that was added this week were an implementation of the list, which might need more work, and again, major bug fixes. There were several small problems with the way comparisons were done in the priority queues and in the MinHeap. A couple of new tests were added, too.

Some more work is to be done on utility stuff next week, and the implementation and testing documentation along with the performance testing will begin next week as well. And, of course, replacing datastructures with own implementations.


Time spent this week: ~18h
