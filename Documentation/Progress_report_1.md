# Progress report 1

This first week was a short one and only the foundations of the project were set up. Apart from choosing the topic, I've only worked on the project specification document so far. I also did some research on the implementation of the algorithms and datastructures, and on what the input data looks like and how to actually use it in the project. Nothing has caused problems yet. For next week the work will consists of setting up the project to read the inputs, and of the implementation of the algorithms.
